#### MiddleEarth
This is a simple android app built for the **ALC  #7DaysofCodeChallenge**.
The app tests the user's knowledge of the 'world' presented in *The Hobbit* and in *The Lord of the Rings*.

You can take the app for a spin from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NpHLCc5zYR-aTpHhf1zVMvGM4szmRX_O/view?usp=sharing).
